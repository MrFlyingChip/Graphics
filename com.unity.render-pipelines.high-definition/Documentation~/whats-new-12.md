# What's new in HDRP version 12 / Unity 2021.2

This page contains an overview of new features, improvements, and issues resolved in version 12 of the High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP), embedded in Unity 2021.2.

## Features

The following is a list of features Unity added to version 12 of the High Definition Render Pipeline, embedded in Unity 2021.2. Each entry includes a summary of the feature and a link to any relevant documentation.



## Improvements

### Dynamic Resolution Scale
This version of HDRP introduces multiple improvements to Dynamic Resolution Scaling: 
- The exposure and pixel to pixel quality now match between the software and hardware modes.
- The rendering artifact that caused black edges to appear on screen when in hardware mode no longer occurs.
- The rendering artifacts that appeared when using the Lanczos filter in software mode no longer occur.
- Hardware mode now utilizes the Contrast Adaptive Sharpening filter to prevent the results from looking too pixelated. This uses FidelityFX (CAS) AMDâ„¢. For information about FidelityFX and Contrast Adaptive Sharpening, see [AMD FidelityFX](https://www.amd.com/en/technologies/radeon-software-fidelityfx).


### AOV API

From HDRP 12.0, The AOV API includes the following improvements:
- It is now possible to override the render buffer format that is used internally by HDRP when rendering **AOVs**. This can be done by a call to aovRequest.SetOverrideRenderFormat(true);
- There is now a world space position output buffer (see DebugFullScreen.WorldSpacePosition).
- The MaterialSharedProperty.Specular output now includes sensible information even for materials that use the metallic workflow (by converting the metallic parameter to fresnel 0).

### Additional Properties

From HDRP 12.0, More Options have become Additional Properties. The way to access them has also changed. The cogwheel that was present in component headers has been replaced by an entry in the contextual menu. When you enable additional properties, Unity highlights the background of each additional property for a few seconds to show you where they are.

## Issues resolved
